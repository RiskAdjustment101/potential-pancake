# /review

Perform a comprehensive code review of recent changes.  

## Steps
1. Read the diff or changed files.  
2. Produce a **risk-ranked checklist** with two sections:  
   - Must Fix (logic bugs, security issues, a11y, performance, broken tests)  
   - Nice to Have (style, naming, small refactors, comments)  
3. Link directly to affected lines or files.  
4. Ask: "Do you want me to fix the Must Fix items now?"  
5. If yes, propose changes one file at a time; show diffs before applying.  
6. Summarize review results and fixes.  

## Scope
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and accessibility.  
- Ensure UI follows **shadcn/ui dark theme tokens** from `CLAUDE.md`.  
- Ensure new code has at least one unit or component test.
