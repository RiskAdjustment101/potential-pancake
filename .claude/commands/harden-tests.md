# /harden-tests

Improve testing quality and coverage on recent changes.  

## Steps
1. Analyze changed files since last commit.  
2. Identify **gaps** in unit, RTL (React Testing Library), integration, or E2E (Playwright).  
3. Add or extend tests to bring **coverage â‰¥80% lines** on changed files.  
4. Mark any flaky tests and suggest stabilization.  
5. Run all tests locally; show summary and coverage report.  
6. Ask: "Do you want me to commit these new tests now?"  

## Scope
- No brittle mocks; test **behavior, not implementation details**.  
- Prefer small, meaningful tests over exhaustive boilerplate.  
- Update CI config if new test suites are introduced.
