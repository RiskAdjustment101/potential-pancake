## ⚡ Phase 1 — Foundation (Weeks 1–4)

**Goal:** Establish a usable Mentor Assistant baseline.

**Scope**

- Core repo + docs + CI/CD.
- **Authentication (Clerk): mentor account creation + persistence.**
- Season Planner (UI + persistence).
- Basic agendas + parent comms generator.
- Thin rubric-aligned feedback (code/project snippets).

- Season Planner (UI + persistence).
- Basic agendas + parent comms generator.
- Thin rubric-aligned feedback (code/project snippets).

**Milestones**

- Repo scaffolding with CLAUDE.md + testing infra.
- Season plan vertical slice merged.
- First mentor-facing demo (plan + agenda).

**Success Metric**

- Mentor can generate a season plan + 1 agenda in first use.

# ✅ Notes on AI Development Pace

- **AI co-dev compresses timelines**: what might take 6 months traditionally could be 6 weeks here.
- Treat phases as **capability gates**, not rigid dates.
- Each phase ends with a **demo + user validation** (ideally with a real mentor or teacher).
