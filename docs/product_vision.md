# Product Vision — FLL Mentor Copilot

## 🚀 Aspirational Vision (North Star)

- **First Principles:** The bottleneck in FLL isn’t student passion but mentor bandwidth and fragmented resources.
- **10x Goal:** Enable one mentor to support 10x more students without burnout.
- Imagine:
  - Click **“Start Season”** → get a fully generated 12-week plan, class schedule, and parent comms.
  - Students auto-enrolled in **classes**, every session auto-documented (attendance, code, robot build photos, reflections).
  - By season end, each student has a **digital portfolio** and each team a **judge-ready dossier**.
- **System-level Impact:** Schools and STEM nonprofits can scale from a handful of FLL teams → hundreds, with no added admin load.

### Core Pillars

1. **Autopilot Season** → Plans, comms, and agendas run themselves.
2. **AI Mentor Assistant** → Debugging, rubric reviews, and design guidance.
3. **Class Engine** → Student enrollment + session documentation.
4. **Marketplace Network** → Best strategies and resources shared and monetized.

## 🛠 Grounded Execution (MVP Path)

### Problem Today

- Mentors are overwhelmed by planning, communication, and keeping up with rules.
- Students lack structured lesson flow + documented progress.

### Target Users

- **Secondary:** Teachers, after-school coordinators, STEM centers.

### MVP Value Proposition

- Generate a **season plan** in <5 minutes.
- Draft **weekly agendas** and **parent emails** automatically.
- Provide **rubric-aligned code/project feedback**.
- **(Stretch Goal Phase 2):** Create classes, enroll students, and document sessions.

### Differentiation

- Not a generic chatbot → FLL-specific, rubric-aware, structured.
- Combines **mentor guidance + student tracking + curated resources** in one.
- Builds **confidence and clarity** for first-time mentors.

- ⚪ Marketplace for community-shared resources.

### Success Criteria (MVP)
