# Product Vision — FLL Mentor Copilot

## 🚀 Aspirational Vision (North Star)

- **First Principles:** The bottleneck in FLL isn’t student passion but mentor bandwidth and fragmented resources.  
- **10x Goal:** Enable one mentor to support 10x more students without burnout.  
- Imagine:  
  - Click **“Start Season”** → get a fully generated 12-week plan, class schedule, and parent comms.  
  - Students auto-enrolled in **classes**, every session auto-documented (attendance, code, robot build photos, reflections).  
  - By season end, each student has a **digital portfolio** and each team a **judge-ready dossier**.  
- **System-level Impact:** Schools and STEM nonprofits can scale from a handful of FLL teams → hundreds, with no added admin load.  

### Core Pillars
1. **Autopilot Season** → Plans, comms, and agendas run themselves.  
2. **AI Mentor Assistant** → Debugging, rubric reviews, and design guidance.  
3. **Class Engine** → Student enrollment + session documentation.  
4. **Marketplace Network** → Best strategies and resources shared and monetized.

## 🛠 Grounded Execution (MVP Path)

### Problem Today
- Mentors are overwhelmed by planning, communication, and keeping up with rules.  
- Students lack structured lesson flow + documented progress.  

### Target Users
- **Primary:** Parent mentors (non-technical, time-poor).  
- **Secondary:** Teachers, after-school coordinators, STEM centers.  

### MVP Value Proposition
- Generate a **season plan** in <5 minutes.  
- Draft **weekly agendas** and **parent emails** automatically.  
- Provide **rubric-aligned code/project feedback**.  
- **(Stretch Goal Phase 2):** Create classes, enroll students, and document sessions.  

### Differentiation
- Not a generic chatbot → FLL-specific, rubric-aware, structured.  
- Combines **mentor guidance + student tracking + curated resources** in one.  
- Builds **confidence and clarity** for first-time mentors.  

### Execution Priorities (Phase 1)
- ✅ Mentor Assistant (season planner, comms, rubric helper).  
- ⚪ Ops Concierge (agendas, supply lists).  
- ⚪ Thin Judging Prep (basic rubric feedback).  

### Stretch (Phase 2)
- ⚪ Class Engine (student enrollment + documentation).  
- ⚪ Marketplace for community-shared resources.  

### Success Criteria (MVP)
- A new mentor can generate a season plan + 1 agenda in their first session.  
- At least one code snippet reviewed against rubric before competition.  
- Mentors report **>50% reduction in prep time**.
